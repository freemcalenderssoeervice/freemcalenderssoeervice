Brainstorm ways to find quick cash: If your need is relatively small, you may not have to borrow money. There are ways to make fast money by getting creative, such as selling spare electronics or unused gift cards, or taking on a temporary side gig.

Apply for a credit union’s payday alternative loan: Payday alternative loans let you borrow small amounts of money at a lower cost and with a longer repayment term than a payday loan. These loans are offered at federal credit unions, though local credit unions may have similar products. You’ll need to become a member of the credit union before applying.

Download a cash advance app: Cash advance apps can help you cover an emergency expense by letting you borrow from your next paycheck before you receive it. Tread lightly with apps, though, because some charge a small fee with each advance and users may become financially dependent on the service.
