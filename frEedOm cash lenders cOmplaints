Banks, credit unions and online lenders offer secured loans. Eligibility is typically based on the value of your collateral as well as your credit and finances. Youâ€™ll often undergo a hard credit check when you apply for a secured loan.

Most secured loans have fixed interest rates, meaning you'll repay the loan in equal monthly installments. If the lender reports payments to the three major credit bureaus, on-time payments will build your credit, but missed payments will damage it. After multiple missed payments, the lender can take your collateral.
